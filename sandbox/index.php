   <h1>Simpletip2 is now discontinued due to supposed copyright infringement</h1>
   
   It was a good run, but unfortunately my own arrogance to the scope of this project led me to make some very bad decisions regarding the design of this site, most notably the copying of anothers layout for my own purposes. I gladly hold my hands up to the fact that, in my rush to provide others with a service, I neglected to think about what I was actually doing - infringing copyright. 
   <br /><br />
   I'd like to make one thing abunduntly clear about this whole situation, and that is that <b>no code</b> was ever "adapted, transformed or built upon" as per the terms of the license I supposidly infringed upon. My one and only mistake in this matter was utilising a, to use the term loosely, "competitors" design, and since I have neither the time nor the resources to fight a legal battle between myself and Nick, the project will henceforth be discontinued.
   <br /><br />
   I take this as a life lesson, and hopefully those of you who read this will too, because this incident almost cost me something very valuable to me, my reputation.
   <br /><br />
   Please direct all questions about this infringement to <a href="http://www.nickstakenburg.com">Nick Stakenburg</a> and his Prototip<sup>2</sup> project.
